A simple web aplication where to visualize TV shows by category and rating.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Technologies used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

I decided to use Vite for the setup because it's a really fast and popular way to create a web aplication.

As a framework I used VueJs because I find the Single-File Components very clean and well structured.

For the store management I decided to use Pinia because it's very simple and works well with Composition API.

I wrote the Unit tests with Vitest because it comes out-of-the-box with Vite and it's really similar to Jest which I have used in the past.
